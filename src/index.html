<h2>Game play</h2>
<p>Fire thrusters in the direction of travel
to raise the opposite side of the orbit.
Fire thrusters against the direction of travel
to lower the opposite side of the orbit.

<p>Shoot or dodge any obstacles that come your way.
If you destroy all of the balls without getting hit, you win.

<p>Bullets travel farther and faster when fired in the direction of travel
at the low point of the orbit, where the ship is moving most rapidly.
Fast bullets are colored and score critical hits.

<p>Be careful not to fly too close to the Sun or you will be
burned to a cinder!

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Orbits are hard to change, so choose your orbit carefully.
  <li>Try to anticipate the direction that the balls will be coming at you
  from, and be ready to shoot them before they get a chance to hit you.
  <li>Shoot down smaller balls completely before breaking up larger ones,
  otherwise you may end up in the midst of a swarm.
</ul>

<h2>About Kepler</h2>

<p>Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), was a German astronomer and mathematician
famous for his three laws of planetary motion. These state that:

<ol>
  <li>The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
  <li>A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas
  during equal intervals of time.
  <li>The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of
  the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
</ol>

<p>Kepler was a major figure in the scientific revolution of the 17th century,
placing our understanding of orbits on a precise geometric footing.
His work built on Copernicus' heliocentric system, and laid the groundwork
for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation.

<p>This was at a time when astronomy was considered more a part of the
liberal arts than of natural philosophy (that is, physics), and indeed
Kepler was still highly influenced by classical notions such as the
<q>music of the spheres.</q> As such, his work was largely ignored by
contemporary mathematicians and physicists like Descartes and Galileo,
with him perhaps being seen as an eccentric anomaly.  At the same time,
his work raised objections from astronomers such as his own teacher,
Michael Maestlin.

<p>He died in 1630 at the age of 59, in Regensburg in the Holy Roman Empire.
He was buried in a Protestant churchyard that was subsequently destroyed
during the Thirty Years' War.

<p>Relatively little is known about his balls.
