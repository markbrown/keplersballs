Fire thrusters against the direction of travel to shrink the ship's orbit.</p><p>Shoot or dodge any obstacles that come your way. If you destroy all of the balls without getting hit, you win.</p><p>Bullets travel farther and faster when fired in the direction of travel at the low point of the orbit, where the ship is moving most rapidly. Fast bullets are colored and score critical hits.</p><p>Be careful not to fly too close to the Sun or you will overheat.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Orbits are hard to change, so choose your orbit carefully.</li><li>If the orbit is too small you will heat up over time. Keep an eye on the temperature gauge!</li><li>Shoot balls as soon as possible if their orbit crosses yours, otherwise they can be safely left for later.</li></ul><h2>About Kepler</h2><p>Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), was a German astronomer and mathematician famous for his three laws of planetary motion. These state that:</p><ol><li>The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.</li><li>A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.</li><li>The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the ellipse.</li></ol><p>Kepler was a major figure in the scientific revolution of the 17th century, placing our understanding of orbits on a precise geometric footing. His work built on Copernicus' heliocentric system, and laid the groundwork for Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation.</p><p>This was at a time when astronomy was considered more a part of the liberal arts than of natural philosophy (that is, physics), and indeed Kepler was still highly influenced by classical notions such as the <q>music of the spheres.</q> As such, his work was largely ignored by contemporary mathematicians and physicists like Descartes and Galileo, with him perhaps being seen as an eccentric anomaly. At the same time, his work raised objections from astronomers such as his own teacher, Michael Maestlin.</p><p>He died in 1630 at the age of 59, in Regensburg in the Holy Roman Empire. He was buried in a Protestant churchyard that was subsequently destroyed during the Thirty Years' War.</p><p>Relatively little is known about his balls.</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
