<h2>Game play</h2>
<p>Fire thrusters in the direction of travel
to raise the opposite side of the orbit.
Fire thrusters against the direction of travel
to lower the opposite side of the orbit.
These moves have maximum effect
at both the lowest and highest points of the orbit.

<p>Shoot or dodge any obstacles that come your way.
If you destroy all of the debris without getting hit, you win.

<p>Bullets travel farther and faster when fired in the direction of travel
at the low point of the orbit, where the ship is moving most rapidly.
Extra fast bullets are colored and score critical hits.

<p>Be careful not to fly too close to the Sun or you will be
burned to a cinder!

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Orbits are hard to change, so choose your orbit carefully.
  <li>Try to anticipate the direction that the globules will be coming at you
  from, given their orbits, and be ready to shoot them down before they get a
  chance to hit you.
  <li>Shoot down smaller globules completely before breaking up larger ones,
  otherwise you may end up in the midst of a swarm of them.
</ul>

<h2>About Kepler</h2>

<p>Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), was a German astronomer and mathematician
famous for his three laws of planetary motion. These state that:

<ol>
  <li>The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
  <li>A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas
  during equal intervals of time.
  <li>The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of
  the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
</ol>

<p>Kepler was a major figure in the scientific revolution of the 17th century,
taking our understanding of orbits beyond just <q>epicycles</q> and
onto a precise geometric formulation. His work built on Copernicus'
heliocentric system, and laid the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of
universal gravitation.

<p>Granted, this was at a time when astronomy was considered more a part of the
liberal arts than of natural philosophy (that is, physics), and indeed
Kepler was still highly influenced by the Ptolemaic system and classical
notions such as the <q>music of the spheres.</q> As such, his work
was largely ignored by contemporary mathematicians and physicists like
Descartes and Galileo, with him perhaps being seen as something of an
eccentric anomaly. At the same time, his work raised objections from
astronomers such as his own teacher, Michael Maestlin.

<p>He died in 1630 at the age of 59, in Regensburg in the Holy Roman Empire.
He was buried in a Protestant churchyard that was subsequently destroyed
during the Thirty Years' War.

<p>Relatively little is known about his balls.
