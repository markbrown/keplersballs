## Game play

Fire thrusters in the direction of travel
to raise the opposite side of the orbit.
Fire thrusters against the direction of travel
to lower the opposite side of the orbit.
These moves have maximum effect
at both the lowest and highest points of the orbit.

Shoot or dodge any obstacles that come your way.
If you destroy all of the debris without getting hit, you win.

Bullets travel farther and faster when fired in the direction of travel
at the low point of the orbit, where the ship is moving most rapidly.
Extra fast bullets can score critical hits.

Be careful not to fly too close to the Sun or you will be
burned to a cinder!
